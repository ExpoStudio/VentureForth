Welcome to Venture Forth!

This is a simple console application game (runs in command prompt) RPG turn-based game created in C, where the goal is simply to defeat the enemies you encounter

Controls are very simple, and can be played using the numberpad.

The enemies scale in health and damage output as you level up.

This game features a shop with purchasable upgrades and perishables from currency earned by defeating enemies; and achievements.

This is my first ever game made with an actual coding language,  using C.
